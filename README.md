# üéôÔ∏è OpenWhisper Transcriber

A Python script that records audio from your microphone, transcribes it using OpenAI's Speech-To-Text, and copies the text to your clipboard. It uses a global hotkey to start and stop recording, making it easy to capture audio from any application.

## ‚ú® Features

- **‚å®Ô∏è Global Hotkey**: Press `Ctrl + Insert` anywhere in your OS to start or stop recording.
- **üîä Audio Cues**: Plays sounds to indicate the start of recording and successful transcription.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Automatic Transcription**: Uses the OpenAI API for high-quality audio-to-text conversion.
- **üìã Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copies the transcribed text to the clipboard for immediate use.
- **‚ö° Low Latency**: Designed for quick and efficient transcription.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- An OpenAI API key
- uv

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the script):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/openwhisper.git
    cd openwhisper
    ```

2.  **Set your OpenAI API Key:**
    The script requires your OpenAI API key to be set as an environment variable.

    For Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
    ```

    To make this permanent, add it to your shell's profile script (e.g., `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, or your PowerShell profile).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Run the script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    uv run transcriber.py
    ```
    The script will run in the background and listen for the hotkey.

2.  **Start/Stop Recording:**
    - Press `Ctrl + Insert` to start recording. You will hear a "start" sound.
    - Press `Ctrl + Insert` again to stop recording.

3.  **Get Your Transcription:**
    - After stopping the recording, the script saves the audio to `recorded_audio.wav`.
    - It then sends the audio to the OpenAI API for transcription.
    - The transcribed text is printed to the console and copied to your clipboard. You will hear a "success" sound.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

You can modify the following constants in `transcriber.py`:
- `hotkey`: Change the key combination for toggling the recording in the `main` function.
- `prompt`: In the `transcribe` function, you can change the prompt sent to OpenAI to better suit your needs.
